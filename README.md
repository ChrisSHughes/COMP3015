# COMP3015
Repo for COMP3015 coursework

This project was built using Visual Studio's 2019, on a Windows 10 pc.

<H!> How To Run: </H1>
Download this repo, and unzip the Comp3015.zip file.

Inside this file there is an Executable for Project_Template. Double click this .exe file to run the project.

<H1> What is it? </H1>
This project uses c++ and OpenGL to render custom Objects from .obj files and applies lighting and shaders to them. This project has 2 custom object files for a Womans Head, and a UFO. This project uses a Phong Model Shader to apply lighting to objects, using Ambient, Diffuse and Specular lighting.

Initially this project started with a vertex array which was used to render a triangle, but this was replaced with custom .OBJ file loading.

This project uses a Vertices and Fragment shader file to calculate the Ambient, Diffuse and Specular lighting, and applies it to the Objects in the scene. The lighting valuers are multiplied with the corrisponding Matarial values given to each object to change how the light interacts with the object.

<H1> What do i expect to get? </H1>

I imagine i will probably get around 40 - 46 marks for this module, due to how difficult it was to learn this.
